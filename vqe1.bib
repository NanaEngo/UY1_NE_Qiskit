  abstract      = {Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology will be available in         the near future. Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be         able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today's         classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will         limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed         reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-         body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications,         but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world         right away - we should regard it as a significant step toward         the more powerful quantum technologies of the future. Quantum         technologists should continue to strive for more accurate         quantum gates and, eventually, fully fault-tolerant quantum         computing.},

  abstract      = {Many quantum algorithms have daunting resource requirements when         compared to what is available today. To address this         discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme         known as {\textquoteleft}the quantum variational         eigensolver{\textquoteright} was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014         Nat. Commun. <A href=``http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5213''>5         4213</A>) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum         resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with         classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of         this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for         practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a         variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster         where we establish a connection from second order unitary         coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of         exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of         quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to         be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold         quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and         correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce         the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of         modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer         dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of         magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

One         powerful example of such a hybrid quantum-classical approach         optimized for classically intractable eigenvalue problems is the         variational quantum eigensolver, built to utilize quantum         resources for the solution of eigenvalue problems and         optimizations with minimal coherence time requirements by         leveraging classical computational resources. These algorithms         have been placed as leaders among the candidates for the first         to achieve supremacy over classical computation. Here, we         provide evidence for the conjecture that variational approaches         can automatically suppress even nonsystematic decoherence errors         by introducing an exactly solvable channel model of variational         state preparation. Moreover, we develop a more general hierarchy         of measurement and classical computation that allows one to         obtain increasingly accurate solutions by leveraging additional         measurements and classical resources. We demonstrate numerically         on a sample electronic system that this method both allows for         the accurate determination of excited electronic states as well         as reduces the impact of decoherence, without using any         additional quantum coherence time or formal error-correction         codes.},

The library provides a unified architecture for near-term         quantum computing devices, supporting both qubit and continuous-         variable paradigms. PennyLane's core feature is the ability to         compute gradients of variational quantum circuits in a way that         is compatible with classical techniques such as backpropagation.         PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms         common in optimization and machine learning to include quantum         and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework         compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We         provide plugins for Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, Qiskit,         Cirq, and ProjectQ, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run         on publicly accessible quantum devices provided by Rigetti and         IBM Q. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with         accelerated machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow,         PyTorch, and autograd. PennyLane can be used for the         optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum         approximate optimization, quantum machine learning models, and         many other applications.},

        optimization tasks, with applications ranging from quantum
        chemistry and drug discovery to machine learning. In many
        settings, most prominently in so-called parametrized or
        variational algorithms, the objective function is a result of
        hybrid quantum-classical processing. To optimize the objective,
        it is useful to have access to exact gradients of quantum
        circuits with respect to gate parameters. This paper shows how
        gradients of expectation values of quantum measurements can be
        estimated using the same, or almost the same, architecture that
        executes the original circuit. It generalizes previous results
        for qubit-based platforms, and proposes recipes for the
        computation of gradients of continuous-variable circuits.
        Interestingly, in many important instances it is sufficient to
        run the original quantum circuit twice while shifting a single
        gate parameter to obtain the corresponding component of the
        gradient. More general cases can be solved by conditioning a
        single gate on an ancilla. <P />}},

        machine learning in the classical context, we propose quantum

        be trained classically then transferred to the quantum setting

        provide qubit-efficient schemes in which, depending on the
        architecture, the number of physical qubits required scales only
        logarithmically with, or independently of the input or output

Within the field of         quantum chemistry, this structure is termed the fermionic         n-representability conditions, and is supported by a vast amount         of literature on both theoretical and practical results related         to their approximations. In this work, we introduce these         conditions in the language of quantum computation, and utilize         them to develop several techniques to accelerate and improve         practical applications for quantum chemistry on quantum         computers. As a general result, we demonstrate how these         marginals concentrate to diagonal quantities when measured on         random quantum states. We also show that one can use fermionic         n-representability conditions to reduce the total number of         measurements required by more than an order of magnitude for         medium sized systems in chemistry. As a practical demonstration,         we simulate an efficient restoration of the physicality of         energy curves for the dilation of a four qubit diatomic hydrogen         system in the presence of three distinct one qubit error         channels, providing evidence these techniques are useful for         pre-fault tolerant quantum chemistry experiments.},

  abstract = {One of the key applications for quantum computers will be the simulation         of other quantum systems that arise in chemistry, materials         science, etc., in order to accelerate the process of discovery.         It is important to ask the following question: Can this         simulation be achieved using near-future quantum processors, of         modest size and under imperfect control, or must it await the         more distant era of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum         computing? Here, we propose a variational method involving         closely integrated classical and quantum coprocessors. We         presume that all operations in the quantum coprocessor are prone         to error. The impact of such errors is minimized by boosting         them artificially and then extrapolating to the zero-error case.         In comparison to a more conventional optimized Trotterization         technique, we find that our protocol is efficient and appears to         be fundamentally more robust against error accumulation.},

  abstract      = {The preparation of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of         the most promising near-term applications of small quantum         computers, especially if the circuit is short enough and the         fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without         quantum error correction. Such quantum state preparation can be         used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the         circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state         for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a         simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by         adiabatic state preparation. We test its accuracy and determine         the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with         up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small molecules. We         find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed         schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required         number of measurements is astronomically large for quantum         chemistry applications to molecules, applying the variational         approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to         be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum         computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state         preparation using short quantum circuits, to prepare trial         ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state         preparation.},

  abstract = {Quantum simulation of the electronic structure problem is one of the         most researched applications of quantum computing. The majority         of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction         using N Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with O         (N$^{4}$) second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and         extend methods to condensed phase materials by utilizing a dual         form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential         operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with O         (N$^{2}$) second-quantized terms. Using this representation, we         can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with         linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis         allow us to deploy Trotter- and Taylor-series-based simulations         with respective circuit depths of O (N$^{7 /2}$) and O         {\ensuremath{\sim}}(N$^{8 /3}$) for fixed charge densities.         Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer         measurements in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of         that approach. While our approach applies to the simulation of         arbitrary electronic structure problems, the basis sets explored         in this work will be most practical for treating periodic         systems, such as crystalline materials, in the near term. We         conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas         (jellium) using a low-depth variational ansatz realizable on         near-term quantum devices. From these results, we identify         simulations of low-density jellium as a promising first setting         to explore quantum supremacy in electronic structure.},

In this paper, we         study the application of VQE to the simulation of molecular         energies using the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz.

We illustrate our methodology         with numerical simulations for a system of four hydrogen atoms         that exhibit strong correlation and show that the circuit depth         of VQE using a UCC ansatz can be reduced without introducing         significant loss of accuracy in the final wavefunctions and         energies.},

One         frequently mentioned application is Feynman's original proposal         of simulating quantum systems and, in particular, the electronic         structure of molecules and materials. In this paper, we analyze         the computational requirements for one of the standard         algorithms to perform quantum chemistry on a quantum computer.         We focus on the quantum resources required to find the ground         state of a molecule twice as large as what current classical         computers can solve exactly. We find that while such a problem         requires about a 10-fold increase in the number of qubits over         current technology, the required increase in the number of gates         that can be coherently executed is many orders of magnitude         larger.

Prior work has bounded errors due to Trotterization in         terms of the norm of the error operator and analyzed scaling         with respect to the number of spin-orbitals. However, we find         that these error bounds can be loose by up to sixteen orders of         magnitude for some molecules. Furthermore, numerical results for         small systems fail to reveal any clear correlation between         ground state error and number of spin-orbitals. We instead argue         that chemical properties, such as the maximum nuclear charge in         a molecule and the filling fraction of orbitals, can be decisive         for determining the cost of a quantum simulation. Our analysis         motivates several strategies to use classical processing to         further reduce the required Trotter step size and to estimate         the necessary number of steps, without requiring additional         quantum resources. Finally, we demonstrate improved methods for         state preparation techniques which are asymptotically superior         to proposals in the simulation literature.},

  abstract      = {Calculating molecular energies is likely to be one of the first useful         applications to achieve quantum supremacy, performing faster on         a quantum than a classical computer. However, if future quantum         devices are to produce accurate calculations, errors due to         environmental noise and algorithmic approximations need to be         characterized and reduced. In this study, we use the high         performance qHiPSTER software to investigate the effects of         environmental noise on the preparation of quantum chemistry         states. We simulated eighteen 16-qubit quantum circuits under         environmental noise, each corresponding to a unitary coupled         cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular         configuration. Additionally, we analyze the nature of simple         gate errors in noise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find         that the Jordan-Wigner (JW) encoding produces consistently         smaller errors under a noisy environment as compared to the         Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding, pure-dephasing         noise is shown to produce substantially smaller errors than pure         relaxation noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends         in both molecular energy and electron particle number within a         unitary coupled cluster state preparation scheme, against         changes in nuclear charge, bond length, number of electrons,         noise types, and noise magnitude. These trends may prove to be         useful in making algorithmic and hardware-related choices for         quantum simulation of molecular energies.},

  abstract  = {Quantum simulations are bound to be one of the main applications of near-term quantum computers. Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are expected to benefit from these technological developments. Several quantum simulation methods are known to prepare a state on a quantum computer and measure the desired observables. The most resource economic procedure is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), which has traditionally employed unitary coupled cluster as the ansatz to approximate ground states of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians. A significant caveat of the method is that the initial state of the procedure is a single reference product state from a classical Hartree–Fock calculation with no pairing correlations, hence it cannot represent superconducting states. In this work, we propose to improve the method by initializing the algorithm with a more general fermionic Gaussian state, an idea borrowed from the field of nuclear physics. We show how this Gaussian reference state can be prepared with a linear-depth circuit of quantum matchgates. By augmenting the set of available gates with nearest-neighbor phase coupling, we generate a low-depth circuit ansatz that can accurately prepare the ground state of correlated fermionic systems. This extends the range of applicability of the VQE to systems with strong pairing correlations such as superconductors, atomic nuclei, and topological materials.},

  abstract      = {Quantum simulation is an important application of future quantum         computers with applications in quantum chemistry, condensed         matter, and beyond. Quantum simulation of fermionic systems         presents a specific challenge. The Jordan-Wigner transformation         allows for representation of a fermionic operator by O(n) qubit         operations. Here, we develop an alternative method of simulating         fermions with qubits, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev [Ann.         Phys. 298, 210 (2002), 10.1006/aphy.2002.6254; e-print arXiv         :quant-ph/0003137v2], that reduces the simulation cost to O(log         n) qubit operations for one fermionic operation. We apply this         new Bravyi-Kitaev transformation to the task of simulating         quantum chemical Hamiltonians, and give a detailed example for         the simplest possible case of molecular hydrogen in a minimal         basis. We show that the quantum circuit for simulating a single         Trotter time step of the Bravyi-Kitaev derived Hamiltonian for         H$_{2}$ requires fewer gate applications than the equivalent         circuit derived from the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Since the         scaling of the Bravyi-Kitaev method is asymptotically better         than the Jordan-Wigner method, this result for molecular         hydrogen in a minimal basis demonstrates the superior efficiency         of the Bravyi-Kitaev method for all quantum computations of         electronic structure.},

  abstract      = {Simulating fermionic lattice models with qubits requires mapping         fermionic degrees of freedom to qubits. The simplest method for         this task, the Jordan-Wigner transformation, yields strings of         Pauli operators acting on an extensive number of qubits. This         overhead can be a hindrance to implementation of qubit-based         quantum simulators, especially in the analog context. Here we         thus review and analyze alternative fermion-to-qubit mappings,         including the two approaches by Bravyi and Kitaev and the         auxiliary fermion transformation. The Bravyi-Kitaev transform is         reformulated in terms of a classical data structure and         generalized to achieve a further locality improvement for local         fermionic models on a rectangular lattice. We conclude that the         most compact encoding of the fermionic operators can be done         using ancilla qubits with the auxiliary fermion scheme. Without         introducing ancillas, a variant of the Bravyi-Kitaev transform         provides the most compact fermion-to-qubit mapping for Hubbard-         like models.},

While low-         depth quantum algorithms, such as the variational quantum         eigenvalue solver (VQE), have been used to determine ground         state energies, methods for calculating excited states currently         involve the implementation of high-depth controlled-unitaries or         a large number of additional samples. Here we show how overlap         estimation can be used to deflate eigenstates once they are         found, enabling the calculation of excited state energies and         their degeneracies. We propose an implementation that requires         the same number of qubits as VQE and at most twice the circuit         depth. Our method is robust to control errors, is compatible         with error-mitigation strategies and can be implemented on near-         term quantum computers.},

  abstract      = {Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems         and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics         that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems,         problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance         computers. Finding exact solutions to such problems numerically         has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size         of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to         the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical         computational methods have made solving even few-atom         electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation         using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet experimental         implementations have so far been restricted to molecules         involving only hydrogen and helium. Here we demonstrate the         experimental optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six         qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, determining the         ground-state energy for molecules of increasing size, up to         BeH$_{2}$. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum         eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepared trial         states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that         are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact         encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic         optimization routine. We demonstrate the flexibility of our         approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an         antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic         field. In all cases, we find agreement between our experiments         and numerical simulations using a model of the device with         noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for         scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap         between key problems in high-performance computing and their         implementation on quantum hardware.},

  abstract     = {Quantum computation, a completely different paradigm of computing, benefits from theoretically proven speed-ups for certain problems and opens up the possibility of exactly studying the properties of quantum systems. Yet, because of the inherent fragile nature of the physical computing elements, qubits, achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations as well as a significant overhead of physical qubits, in order to realize fault-tolerance via quantum error correction. However, recent theoretical work has shown that the accuracy of computation based off expectation values of quantum observables can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of varying noisy experiments. Here, we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors on canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps unearth otherwise inaccessible accuracies to the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will be critical to significantly enhance the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

We         apply it to the problem of learning $k$-fermion reduced density         matrix (RDM), a problem relevant in various quantum simulation         applications. We show that using the ternary-tree mapping one         can determine the elements of all $k$-fermion RDMs, to precision         $\epsilon$, by repeating a single quantum circuit for $\lesssim         (2n+1)^k \epsilon^{-2}$ times.

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

However, due to its single-reference         nature, standard CC in its projected form fails to describe         quantum states characterized by strong electronic correlations         and multi-reference projective methods become necessary. On the         other hand, quantum algorithms for the solution of many-electron         problems have also emerged recently. The quantum UCC with         singles and doubles (q-UCCSD) is a popular wavefunction Ansatz         for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The         variational nature of this approach can lead to significant         advantages compared to its classical equivalent in the projected         form, in particular for the description of strong electronic         correlation. However, due to the large number of gate operations         required in q-UCCSD, approximations need to be introduced in         order to make this approach implementable in a state-of-the-art         quantum computer. In this work, we evaluate several variants of         the standard q-UCCSD Ansatz in which only a subset of         excitations is included. In particular, we investigate the         singlet and pair q-UCCD approaches combined with orbital         optimization. We show that these approaches can capture the         dissociation/distortion profiles of challenging systems such as         H$_4$, H$_2$O and N$_2$ molecules, as well as the one-         dimensional periodic Fermi-Hubbard chain.

In the neural network state ansatz, the complex amplitude function of a quantum state is computed by a neural network. The resulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has proven rich enough to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of various physical systems of interest. In the present paper, we initiate the study of neural network states in quantum information-processing tasks. We demonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing quantum codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error correction, supplying further evidence for the usefulness of neural network states to describe multipartite entanglement. In particular, we show the following main results: (a) neural network states yield quantum codes with a high coherent information for two important quantum channels, the generalized amplitude damping channel and the dephrasure channel. These codes outperform all other known codes for these channels, and cannot be found using a direct parametrization of the quantum state. (b) For the depolarizing channel, the neural network state ansatz reliably finds the best known codes given by repetition codes. (c) Neural network states can be used to represent absolutely maximally entangled states, a special type of quantum error-correcting codes. In all three cases, the neural network state ansatz provides an efficient and versatile means as a variational parametrization of these highly entangled states.},

Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, called Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS), for solving linear systems on near-term quantum computers. VQLS seeks to variationally prepare $|x\rangle$ such that $A|x\rangle\propto|b\rangle$. We derive an operationally meaningful termination condition for VQLS that allows one to guarantee that a desired solution precision $\epsilon$ is achieved. Specifically, we prove that $C \geq \epsilon^2 / \kappa^2$, where $C$ is the VQLS cost function and $\kappa$ is the condition number of $A$. We present efficient quantum circuits to estimate $C$, while providing evidence for the classical hardness of its estimation. Using Rigetti's quantum computer, we successfully implement VQLS up to a problem size of $1024\times1024$. Finally, we numerically solve non-trivial problems of size up to $2^{50}\times2^{50}$. For the specific examples that we consider, we heuristically find that the time complexity of VQLS scales efficiently in $\epsilon$, $\kappa$, and the system size $N$.},

This circuit is most commonly designed to respect the symmetries of the problem Hamiltonian and, in this way, constrain the variational search to a subspace of interest. Here, we show that this approach is not always advantageous by introducing ans\"atze that incorporate symmetry-breaking unitaries. This class of ans\"atze, that we call Quantum-Optimal-Control-inspired Ans\"atze (QOCA), is inspired by the theory of quantum optimal control and leads to an improved convergence of VQAs for some important problems. Indeed, we benchmark QOCA against popular ans\"atze applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling and show that our variational circuits can approximate the ground state of this model with significantly higher accuracy and for larger systems. We also show how QOCA can be used to find the ground state of the water molecule and compare the performance of our ansatz against other common choices used for chemistry problems. This work constitutes a first step towards the development of a more general class of symmetry-breaking ans\"atze with applications to physics and chemistry problems.},

  abstract    = {One of the most promising applications for near term quantum computers is the simulation of physical quantum systems, particularly many-electron systems in chemistry and condensed matter physics. In solid state physics, finding the correct symmetry broken ground state of an interacting electron system is one of the central challenges. The Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (VHA), a variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm especially suited for finding the ground state of a solid state system, will in general not prepare a broken symmetry state unless the initial state is chosen to exhibit the correct symmetry. In this work, we discuss three variations of the VHA designed to find the correct broken symmetry states close to a transition point between different orders. As a test case we use the two-dimensional Hubbard model where we break the symmetry explicitly by means of external fields coupling to the Hamiltonian and calculate the response to these fields. For the calculation we simulate a gate-based quantum computer and also consider the effects of dephasing noise on the algorithms. We find that two of the three algorithms are in good agreement with the exact solution for the considered parameter range. The third algorithm agrees with the exact solution only for a part of the parameter regime, but is more robust with respect to dephasing compared to the other two algorithms.},

  abstract      = {One of the main challenges in the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)         framework is construction of the unitary transformation. The         dimensionality of the space for unitary rotations of $N$ qubits         is $4^N-1$, which makes the choice of a polynomial subset of         generators exponentially difficult process. Moreover, due to         non-commutativity of generators, the order in which they are         used strongly affects results. Choosing the optimal order in a         particular subset of generators requires testing the factorial         number of combinations. We propose an approach based on the Lie         algebra - Lie group connection and corresponding closure         relations that systematically eliminates the order problem.},
